-- A lazy way at doing a config lol

local config = {} -- ignore this line

config.key = "" -- Your Discord token. Self-botting is against ToS, do at your own risk lol

config.limitToGuild = "" -- You can limit it to a specific guild here. Leave blank or as false to disable. This also supports a table.
-- Example of a table: config.limitToGuild = {"123", "456"}

return config
